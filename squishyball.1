.SH NAME
squishyball \- perform sample comparison testing on the command line

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B squishyball
[\fIoptions\fR] fileA [fileB [[\fB-c\fR] \fIfileN...\fR]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B squishyball
is a simple command-line application used to perform double-blind A/B,
A/B/X or X/X/Y testing on the command line.  The user specifies two
input files to be compared and uses the keyboard during playback to
flip between the randomized samples to perform on-the-fly comparisons.
After a predetermined number of trials,
.B squishyball
prints the trial results to the terminal and exits.

.B squishyball
can also be used to perform casual, non-randomized comparisons of
groups of up to ten samples; this is the default mode of operation.

.SH TEST TYPES
.IP "\fB-a --ab"
Perform randomized A/B test on two input samples.

A/B testing randomizes the order of two input samples and presents
them, unnamed, as sample 'A' and sample 'B'.  In each trial the user
selects A or B as the preferred sample.  The samples are then
re-randomized for the next trial.  This test is useful for
establishing relative or preferred quality between two samples.
.IP "\fB-b --abx"
Perform randomized A/B/X test on two input samples.

A/B/X testing randomizes the order of two input samples and presents
them, unnamed, as sample 'A' and sample 'B'.  A third sample 'X' is
also chosen randomly from either either 'A' or 'B'.  In each trial, the
user selects A or B as the sample believed to be the same as X. All
samples are then re-randomized for the next trial. This test is useful
for determining if any differences are audible between two samples and
to what confidence level.
.IP "\fB-c --casual"
Perform casual comparison of up to ten samples (default).

Casual comparison mode does not randomize the input samples or perform
multiple trials.  It simply provides a convenient way to rapidly flip back and
forth within a group of up to ten samples.
.IP "\fB-x --xxy"
Perform randomized X/X/Y test on two input samples.

X/X/Y testing is a form of A/B/X testing in which the position of the 'X'
sample is not known ahead of time to be in the third position. In each trial,
the user selects which of sample 1, 2 or 3 is believed to be the
sample that is different from the other two. This test is useful for
determining if any differences are audible between two samples and to
what confidence level.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-B --beep-flip"
Mark transitions between samples with a short beep.
.IP "\fB-d --device \fIN\fR|\fIdevice"
If a number, output to Nth available sound device.  If a device name,
use output device matching that device name.  The backend audio driver is
selected automatically based on the device name provided.
.IP "\fB-D --force-dither"
Always use dither when down-converting to 16-bit samples for playback
on audio devices that do not support 24-bit playback. By default,
uncompressed samples are always dithered, but lossy formats (such
as Vorbis) are simply rounded.  See the section \fBCONVERSION AND DITHER
\fRbelow for more details.
.IP "\fB-e --end-time \fR[[\fIhh\fB:\fR]\fImm\fB:\fR]\fIss\fR[\fB.\fIff\fR]"
Set sample end time for playback.
.IP "\fB-h --help"
Print usage summary to stdout and exit.
.IP "\fB-M --mark-flip"
Mark transitions between samples with a short period of silence (default).
.IP "\fB-n --trials \fIn"
Set desired number of comparison trials (default: 10).
.IP "\fB-r --restart-after"
Set 'restart-after mode', where sample playback restarts from start point
after every trial.
.IP "\fB-R --restart-every"
Set 'restart-every mode', where sample playback restarts from start point
after 'flip' as well as after every trial.
.IP "\fB-s --start-time \fR[[\fIhh\fB:\fR]\fImm\fB:\fR]\fIss\fR[\fB.\fIff\fR]"
Set start time within sample for playback
.IP "\fB-S --seamless-flip"
Do not mark transitions between samples;
flip with a seamless crossfade.
.IP "\fB-t --force-truncate"
Always round/truncate (never dither) when down-converting samples to 16-bit
for playback on audio devices that do not support 24-bit output.  See the
section \fBCONVERSION AND DITHER\fR below for more details.
.IP "\fB-v --verbose"
Produce more and more detailed progress information and warnings.
.IP "\fB-V --version"
Print version and exit.

.SH SUPPORTED FILE TYPES

.IP \fBWAV/WAVEX
8-, 16-, 24-bit linear integer PCM (format 1), 32-bit float (format 3)
.IP \fBAIFF/AIFF-C
8-, 16-, 24-bit linear integer PCM
.IP \fBFLAC/OggFLAC
16- and 24-bit
.IP \fBSW
Mono signed 16-bit little endian raw with a .sw extension
.IP \fBOggVorbis
all Vorbis I files

.SH CONVERSION AND DITHER
\fBsquishyball \fRloads all linear PCM file types at native bit depth.
Uncompressed floating point files (eg, 32 bit floating point WAV) are
converted to 24-bit integer PCM.  Ogg Vorbis files are also decoded to
24-bit.

Files are 'reconciled' to identical channel ordering, length and
bit-depth before playback begins so that CPU and memory resources usage
during playback should be identical for both samples.  When 24-bit
playback is available and at least one sample is 24-bit, all samples
are promoted to 24 bits. If 24-bit playback is unavailable, 24-bit samples
are demoted to 16 bits.

Floating point samples (32-bit) are not dithered when converting to 24-bit.
24-bit and floating point (32 bit) samples are dithered using a TPDF
when down-conversion to 16-bit is necessary.  Lossy-encoded samples (eg
Ogg Vorbis files) are an exception; they are not dithered by default during
down-conversion. This behavior can be overridden by \fB-D\fR,
which forces dithering for lossy files as well.  Down-conversion
dithering can be disabled for all input types with \fB-t\fR.

.SH IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES
.IP "\fBPlayback Depth and Rate"

Many modern audio playback systems (such as PulseAudio or the
ALSA 'default' device) give no means of determining if the requested
playback paramters are actually being used by the hardware, or if the
audio system is helpfully converting everything to some other
supported depth/rate.  When using these systems, \fBsquishyball\fR has no
way of knowing if 16-/24-bit playback or sample rate is being
honored. Automatic conversion will almost always negatively affect
sample quality.

.IP "\fBFlip-Mode Choice"

\fBSilent Mode\fR smoothly transitions between samples.  It allows
the most direct comparison between signals without any intevening
auditory distraction. However, the temporary combination of different
signals may cause unintended cancellation and comb-filtering effects that can
give away the 'unknown' sample just as a 'pop' would.

\fBMark Mode\fR quickly fades to silence before flipping to another
sample, marking the transition.  Because the samples never overlap,
crosslap artifacts cannot contaminate trial results.  However, the
audible dip between samples can distract from listening, potentially
making it slightly more difficult to detect legitimate artifacts.

\fBBeep Mode\fR smoothly crosslaps samples, momentarily attenuates
the transition, and adds a soft 'beep' to mark where the transition
occurs.  It makes the transition point especially obvious, but may
occasionally suffer from both crosslap artifacts (as in Silent mode)
and momentary distraction (as in Mark mode).
